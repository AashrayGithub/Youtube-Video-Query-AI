Former President Trump says he is okay after being hit by a bullet just minutes into giving a speech at a Pennsylvania rally. The shooter has been killed and one person attending the rally was killed. Two others were injured in the shooting. Trump could be seen reaching for his face and neck, then quickly ducking behind the podium as his Secret Service detail rushed the stage. Several loud bangs continued, the former president appearing to be injured but still pumping his fist to supporters before he was whisked off the stage. A close up shot shows blood coming from the former president's ear. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign also weighing in, saying, quote, President Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders for their quick action during this heinous act. He is fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility. Witnesses who were at the rally describe the frightening moments when they realized what was happening. Somebody started yelling, hit the ground, hit the ground. And when I looked over then I saw the smoke from the gunfire. Just heard puppies. Right away you think about, well, maybe firecrackers and you're kind of stunned and then fire and then like return fire. And then everybody get down. So we got down and we huddled and we just started praying. President Biden addressing the nation after the shooting, denouncing the violence and wishing Trump a speedy recovery. The idea that there's political violence or violence, America like this is just unheard of. It's just not appropriate. And everybody, everybody must condemn it. Everybody. The Secret Service is now investigating this as an assassination attempt. Sources tell Fox the shooter was on the roof of a nearby building and was shot and killed by a secret Service sniper. We're told an AR style rifle was found at the scene. In New York, Connor Hansen, Fox News.
